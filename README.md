# BrisHack 2024
This hackathon was hosted by the University of Bristol's Computer Science Society (CSS) and Electronic and Electrical Engineering Society (BEEES), focusing on health technology innovations.

# Introduction
Welcome to our project aimed at combating childhood obesity through technology and play. As of 2022, childhood obesity has escalated into a critical health challenge globally, with statistics indicating that more than 23% of children aged 10-11 in the UK are classified as obese. Our mission is to tackle this issue head-on by making exercise enjoyable and accessible for children, especially those at risk of obesity.

## Inclusivity and Accessibility
At the heart of our project lies a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. We believe every child, regardless of their physical abilities or environment, should have the opportunity to enjoy exercising and participate in activities that promote a healthy lifestyle. By providing options for camera and IMU-based controls, we aim to accommodate our young users' diverse needs and circumstances and the institutions that support them.

### Camera Integration
Our approach uses a camera for recognising and interpreting a range of physical activities, including jumping, crouching, squatting and arm warning.

This approach encourages active participation and ensures inclusivity, enabling children with disabilities to join in the fun. By adapting the game to recognise different forms of movement, we open up the experience to a broader audience, ensuring no child feels left out.

### Wearable IMU
Acknowledging potential restrictions on camera usage in certain schools, we've integrated wearable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) technology as an alternative. This option allows for monitoring body poses and movements without the need for video recording, ensuring privacy and compliance with different institutional policies.

Additionally, using an IMU provides flexibility, making our game accessible and adaptable to various settings, physical abilities and preferences.
